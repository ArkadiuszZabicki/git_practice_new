## Background

Tickets (questions, projects, consultation, etc) that have been sent in to, and are handled by Service Operations Center (SOC) or Deliverability are generally processed according to the first come first served principle. On top of this they are also generally screened quickly after we received them in order to pick up potential incidents or similarly urgent cases.
 
Sometimes stakeholders to a particular ticket have the need to escalate it. Since all escalations will result in other work being pushed back we need these escalations to happen in a controlled fashion.

## How to Escalate tickets handled by Deliverability / SOC

Delivery and SOC team work with cases that take longer time to complete and therefore need to be scheduled accordingly. We can sometimes prio a case up if the commercial value for doing so is high, but this prio will always be done within the team.

The reason for this is that the team alone has full insight into the various projects and cases that they are working on. If we for example are working on resolving an incident then that work will always get prioritized compared to a delivery to a customer.

All customers (and generally their Account Managers) want their particular cases to be prioritized the highest and done as soon as possible. If we have 100 cases and prio up 99 of these then we effectively do not have any prioritization at all.

 
### Therefore: The only way to increase prio on an open case is to send in a very good motivation for why this particular case needs to be done before all other cases:

- What would happen if this case is not completed before date X?

- Have this customer a particular important deal that we want them to sign?

- Do we see an increased churn risk that we need to mitigate?

Reasons such as "I've forgotten to send this in in time" or "I've promised the customer" are unfortunately not something we will be able to take into account.

## How to send in these requests

To behest higher priority for a ticket you can send your request by:

1. Updating the Submariner ticket - valid update should contain:
   - Motivation for why it should be escalated.
   - For better visibility it's good to post information about adding this request in help-soc channel as well: a link to ticket in SBM with comment about added request for higher prio will suffice. 
2. Posting it in help-soc channel - valid request should contain:
   - Id of Submariner ticket you wish to escalate
   - Motivation for why it should be escalated
3. Sending an email to our support at [support@efficy.com](mailto:support@efficy.com) - email should contain:
   - Id of Submariner ticket you wish to escalate
   - Motivation for why it should be escalated


There is no reason for anyone to send these prioritization requests to anyone personally.
DO NOT send them to neither a manager, the Team Lead nor any single member of the teams.

Doing so will only risk increasing the delivery times since you will then be entirely dependent on this individual to be available (and not occupied with incident; in a meeting or on vacation).
